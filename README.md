# GuitarHerOwO
I made a GuitarHero-like on Unity, using Wwise as Audio API.

Unity version : 2021.1.19f1

Due to 100MB maximum size of file on GitHub, file GeneralBank.bnk and GeneralBank.txt in [Wwise_Project/GeneratedSoundBanks/Windows](/Guitar%20HerOwO_WwiseProject/GeneratedSoundBanks/Windows) has been deleted. That mean the sound in project can't work.

Look at [GuitarHerOwO_Editor](https://github.com/PoplixYann/GuitarHerOwO_Editor), it's a tool that can be used to create map for this project.
